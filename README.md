A quick and dirty way of extracting files from the APK to load them to persistent storage for later use during gameplay. Files can be stored as long as they are not encrypted (by the build process) and stored in StreamingAssets folder. If you have split binary (OBB) enabled in the Player Settings, you need to change the extraction path to the OBB, instead of the APK.
